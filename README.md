# Pazzak
My implementation of star wars card game that is based on blackjack. 

## Rules
card game in which the goal was to come closest to 20 without going over. The player with the highest score less than or equal to 20 won the round, and the player who won three rounds won the match. A round in which the two players tied was not counted.

## TODO
- [ ] improve logic of game
- [ ] improve GUI
- [ ] add random cards in side deck
